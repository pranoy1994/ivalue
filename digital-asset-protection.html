                                <div class="member-about">
                                    Time stamping is an increasingly valuable complement to digital signing practices, enabling organizations to record when
                                    a digital item—such as a message, document, transaction, or piece of software—was signed.
                                    For some applications, the timing of a digital signature is critical, as in the case
                                    of stock trades, lottery ticket issuance, and some legal proceedings. Even when time
                                    is not intrinsic to the application, time stamping is helpful for recordkeeping and audit
                                    processes because it provides a mechanism to prove whether the digital certificate was
                                    actually valid at the time it was used. Because the growing importance of digital signing
                                    solutions is creating a corresponding demand for time stamping, many software programs
                                    and also documents . If time stamping is to add real value, though, the time stamp must
                                    be trustworthy. The time stamping process itself must be secure and based on a trusted
                                    clock. However, modifying the system clock on servers and desktop machines is easy, making
                                    software-based time stamping processes highly vulnerable to tampering. To address this
                                    requirement, organizations can take advantage of public ‘trusted time’ services or can
                                    establish their own secure internal service.To Know More Contact

                                    VPN, an SSL VPN does not require the installation of specialized client software on the
                                    end user’s computer. It’s used to give remote users with access to Web applications,
                                    client/server applications and internal network connections. A virtual private network
                                    (VPN) provides a secure communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted
                                    between two endpoints. An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN devices to which the user
                                    connects by using his Web browser. The traffic between the Web browser and the SSL VPN
                                    device is encrypted with the SSL protocol or its successor, the Transport Layer Security
                                    (TLS) protocol. To Know More Contact
